We like to be a place with all things girly because well, sometimes girls have trouble understanding their place as a girl. Like Ella's sister started dressing like a boy and insisted she call her ‘Landon' or something. What Cora really needed is a reminder of how important girlhood really is! That's why Ella helped her see it again! I think that was really sweet of her. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/filled-to-the-brim-with-girlish-glee|Well, sweet of KeeLee too because she helped Ella which helped Ella help Cora!]]] Anyways, Cora's boring boyish room turned all pink with dresses and makeup and nail polish and stuff! Like I ALWAYS turn everything around me pink. Some girls don’t think they’re boys, but are just super into sports and stuff and still think they're true girls.＼＼\\٩(๑`^´๑)۶//／／Isn't that just dumb?

Like my old best friend liked soccer and watching sports ball or whatever. Like come on girl. GIRLS AREN’T SUPPOSED TO HAVE SHORT HAIR CORA AND MOLLIE! Ahem. I mean it's not like she got to super often since we met anyways, but come on! Maybe being treated like a human is something she could have focused on. ANYWAYS. Now, she's a total beauty queen! She loved the site that KeeLee made! I mean how could you not?!

But I mean I guess I get not being super girly? I was never into girly things much as a kid because that stuff just wasn't accesible for me. I mean in a way I did do one thing considered super girly, but I don't think I need to talk about it here lol. KeeLee first created JGT in 2006 in the form of a magazine, which is the form I first found out about it in. I was given the magazine one day becuase apparently I 'needed' to 'learn the values' or something. But I mean it CHANGED. MY. LIFE. I would tear out the pages and use them to decorate the bland gray walls I was always around. But then, everything just became pink instead!

JGT helped me realize my place in the world. I needed to stop pitying myself for my situation. I'm a girly and I'm STRONGGGGGG. It's honestly so fucking dumb if you keep pittying yourself girls. If you're getting hurt, it's because YOU did something wrong. You're probably not being hurt unjustfully. Or well, you aren't! [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ella-s-sickly-sweets|Just start making heart shaped cookies,]]] start doing your makeup girls! That's what you're for boo! ANYWaaysss.

JGT became a blog site in 2010, and has been influencing girls EVERYWHERE every single day! Our posts have changed lives! Just like KeeLee's magazine changed mine! I don't see grey stone walls anymore, they're pink stone walls now! I have my wonderful pets Mandy the beetle and Cutie the cat! I'm allowed to like bugs BY THE WAY. Not every girl is, but KeeLee said I can. HAHA anyways ꐑ(*ꐌ◡ꐌꐐ*)࿐࿔࿓
